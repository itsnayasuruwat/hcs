# You're_all_I_see

I go hours, sometimes days, not seeing you, And it makes no difference to me. You don’t cross my mind that often, But when you do, I wonder. I wonder if you’re okay, and I’m reminded I haven’t seen you in a while.

Some people call that love, I call it being thoughtful. You see, I can’t even grasp my mind around being in love with you I’m just trying to keep our friendship alive.

But then, I see you, or worse; I hear you. Suddenly The smile I had, The thoughts that ran through my head, The conversation my friend is trying to have, All wiped away.

You’re all I see, all I hear.

I’m engulfed by the thought that I hold no value in your life. I’m reminded that each passing day I say nothing to you, is yet another day I’ll regret. It’s neither happy nor sad, Just yearning in vain.

Then it makes me wonder; is this love? How can it be love when it is only hurt?
